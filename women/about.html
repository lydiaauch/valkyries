			<p>The Valkyries formed in 2001, since then the program has grown greatly. The Valkyries have expanded into two different teams that allow for different levels of intensity and time commitment. This year we have over 70 women involved program wide!</p>
			<p>Our teams do very well each season, with the A team always competing to qualify for the College Women&#39s National Championship. We have flown as far as North Carolina, California, Texas, and Florida to play against nationally ranked teams that challenge and strengthen us.</p>
			<p>Our team is looking to recruit athletes who want to continue to play competitive sports in college, and want to commit to working for this team. There is no prior experience necessary to join the Valkyries; we love to teach this great sport to anyone who is willing to learn.</p>
			<p>We welcome Ultimate players of all levels, and are excited for another successful year!</p>
